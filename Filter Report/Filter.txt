	\subsection*{Overview}
	For this lab we created passive RC low pass and high pass filters that would have a cutoff frequency of 10kHz. We chose the proper value for the resistor and capacitor, observed the waveforms on the oscilloscope and simulated the sinusoidal response in OrCad. We then qualitatively analyzed how the response changed for the sinusoidal, triangle and square waveforms as they were swept through lower and higher frequencies.

	\subsection*{Calculations}
	As a note, throughout these calculations the numbers are exact, not approximations. 
	\subsubsection*{Finding $C$ and $R$}
	The circuit could have many different combinations to produce the expected value of the transfer function of $$H(j\omega)=\frac{1/RC}{j\omega + 1/RC}=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}\angle-45$$ As shown above, we chose $R= 1000 \Omega$ and using $w_c =\frac{1}{RC}$ yields $C=16nF$.
