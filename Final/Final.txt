	\subsection*{Overview}
	Our main design for this project was to create our own signal generator. The generator would operate closely to the ones we have used in lab, except it wouldn't input a sin wave, and the frequency range was not as great, particularly on the low end. 
	In the first week, we had discussed the design and parts needed. We had also finished the schematics, and Jeremy had the PCB layouts ready to be sent out for construction. 
	The second week we had done testing of the generator; took some data and tested its performance. 
	\section*{Performance}
	The generator performed as expected. 
	In our demonstration, we had also used a speaker to listen to the audio of the output signal for the square and triangle waves.
